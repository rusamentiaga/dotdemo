# Dot Product Visualization

This repository presents a visualization of the dot product as a semantic similarity operator. It illustrates how vector alignment encodes similarity in embedding spaces, a principle widely used in information retrieval and representation learning. Beyond similarity measures, the dot product is a fundamental building block of many signal-processing and linear-algebraic transforms, including convolution and the Fourier transform.

The implementation was partially developed using AI-assisted (vibe) coding techniques.
